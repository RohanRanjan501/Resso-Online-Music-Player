<h2>Music-Player-HTML-CSS</h2>

In this project I created the front-end design of a music player in HTML and CSS.

I have uploaded a total of 4 files here :-

index.html.html - It consists of the Home Page's html code of the Music Player.

Single Playlist Screen.html. - It consits of the Single Playlist Screen's html code of the Music Player.

stylesheet_main.css - It consists of the styling for index which is the home page.

Single Playlist Screen Styles.css - It Consists the styling for the Single playlist screen.html which is the playlist screen.

primary page responsive.css
Secondary page responsive.css  } Both of them are the ressponive styling for both of the html pages
